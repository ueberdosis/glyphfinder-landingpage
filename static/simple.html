    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Do you offer a trial?</h3>
    <p>We didn’t implement a trial, but feel free to purchase the app. If you’re not happy send a short message. We’ll refund your order, no questions asked.</p>
    <h3>Does Glyphfinder have all unicode characters in the world?</h3>
    <p>To be honest, not at all. Currently, there are 130.000+ characters in unicode. We focus on Western glyphs and emojis (all!) and filter out everything that can’t be rendered on your system.</p>
    <p>In the end we have 30.000+ characters, all of them manually tagged. That should be enough for your daily work. Let us know if you think anything important is missing!</p>

    <h3>Do you collect my personal data?</h3>
