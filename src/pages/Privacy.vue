      <h1>
        Privacy Policy for the Website
      </h1>
      <p>
        We value your privacy and question everything that stores or processes your personal information. With that in mind, we still needed a few external services to publish Glyphfinder. Here is everything you need to know.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Netlify
      </h3>
      <p>
        We use Netlify to host our static website. It features continuous deployment from Git across a global application delivery network and full integration with Let’s Encrypt. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/privacy/">Read Netlify’s Privacy Policy.</a>
      </p>
      <h3>
        Gumroad
      </h3>
      <p>
        Gumroad is an online platform that enables us to sell Glyphfinder directly to you. <a href="https://gumroad.com/privacy">Read Gumroad’s Privacy Policy</a>
      </p>
      <h3>
        Mailcoach
      </h3>
      <p>
        We use a self-hosted instance of Mailcoach to occasionally send out emails about app updates to you.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Mailgun
      </h3>
      <p>
        To actually deliver the emails to you, we use the service Mailgun. <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/gdpr/">Read more about Mailgun’s Privacy Policy</a>
      </p>
      <h3>
        Plausible
      </h3>
      <p>
        We use <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible</a> to gain insight about our visitors in general. It doesn’t track individual users per se and does not store any personal identifiable information. Go to <a href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">their data policy</a> to find out what Plausible collects (and more importantly what they don’t).
      </p>
      <p>
        Or have a look at the <a href="https://plausible.io/glyphfinder.com">public analytics dashboard</a> they provide. It’s not a stripped down version, it’s the exact same dashboard we use to check the traffic.

        Privacy Policy for Glyphfinder
      </h1>
      <p>
        We don’t track your usage of Glyphfinder. We need an internet connection during the installation though:

      <h3>
        License Check
      </h3>
      <p>
        When you start the app for the first time we ask you for your license key. To check if you have a valid license key, we send the key to the Gumroad API. The result is stored locally and never sent to someone else. <a href="https://help.gumroad.com/article/76-license-keys">Read more about the Gumroad API.</a>
